# Textzee
A text-based version of Yahtzee

The rules in Textzee are the same as Yahtzee. 

It uses up to five "dice" (or five randomly generated numbers, using the Rand crate), each one ranging from 1 to 6. 

Before you build, you should go to rustup.rs (the website) first. After installing Rustup, execute "cargo run" in the folder "textzee". 

# Note to contributers....
We are in need of contributors to make this game more flexible, especially for multiple players without ever exiting the game unless explicitely otherwise. 

We should also allow users to specify the number of human players as well as bot players, with a maximum of 4. 

Matching numbers should be named, such as "two of a kind", "three of a kind", and so on.
